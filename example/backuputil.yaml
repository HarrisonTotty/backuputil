# Example Target Configuration File
# ---------------------------------------

# The "targets" key corresponds to a dictionary of "target specifications" where
# each target specification is given a unique name and contains the information
# relevant to a backup sequence.
targets:
  # ----- Remote Example -----
  user_files:
    # (optional) The certificate to use for validating the remote server
    # identity. Defaults to the value of "--cert-path".
    cert_path: "~/.ssh/backuputil.pem"
    # The destination path corresponding the remote borg repo.
    dst_path: "/borg/storage.example.com/user_files"
    # The hostname or IP of the destination server. The inclusion of this key is
    # what the script uses to identify this as a "remote" backup, as opposed to
    # a "local" one.
    dst_srv: "backup-server.example.com"
    # (optional) A list of paths to exclude from the backup process.
    exclude:
      - "/var/lib/user-files/foo"
      - "/var/lib/user-files/bar"
    # (optional) The archive pruning configuration, as a dictionary of time
    # slices, where each item corresponds to the "number of [slice] backups to
    # keep". Possible keys: "hourly", "daily", "weekly", "monthly", "yearly"
    keep:
      daily: 7
      weekly: 4
      monthly: 6
    # (potentially optional) The password to use when connecting to the remote
    # server. Defaults to the value of "--password".
    password: "SOME PASSWORD"
    # (optional) The rate limit (in KiB/s) to use during the transfer (where 0 =
    # no limit). Defaults to the value of "--rate-limit".
    rate_limit: 1024
    # The source path (or list of source paths) of the content to back-up.
    src_path: "/var/lib/user-files"
    # (optional) The user to use when connecting to the remote server. Defaults
    # to the value of "--user".
    user: "root"

  # ----- Local Example -----
  home:
    dst_path: "/backup/home"
    keep:
      daily: 7
      weekly: 4
      monthly: 6
    # Wildcard paths are also supported:
    src_path: "~/*"

  # ----- Used by Jenkins for Testing -----
  jenkins:
    dst_path: "backup"
    keep:
      daily: 7
      weekly: 4
      monthly: 6
    src_path: "example"
